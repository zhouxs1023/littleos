What's new in 0.1d:
-------------------
* A "good" paging system: all memory is now mapped (high memory)
* Page allocation functions
* kmalloc and kfree functions (seem to work fine, but not really tested)
* time and date functions (but don't currently work)

What's new in 0.1c:
-------------------
* Drivers from Eran: keyboard, mouse and serial, lpt, fd...
* Begin of paging system

What's new in 0.1b:
-------------------
*  This boot sector has been deleted from the archive, because now we only use load.com under DOS.
The boot sector will be done later.
*  There is now a simple logo when you start the OS.
*  Cameron sent me the new loader: load.com (see in boot/load). This loader
is more performant and can load big files. Now, you'll need this to start the
OS (just go to directory bin and type `load').


What is to do (first) ?
----------------------
*  the Multitasking system (first cooperative then later preemptive)
*  more drivers (floppy and hard drives...)
